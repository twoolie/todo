# Todo App

This is a super simple todo app based on the Django web framework.

To install, make sure you have `python > 3.3` and `pip` installed. Then
run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to grab the required libraries.
Finally, in the root directory, run `python manage.py runserver` and
Django will spawn a server at port 8000 that you may connect to and
interact with the app.

CSS is compiled with Compass which can be installed through RubyGems but
is not required to evaluate app.
